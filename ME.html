          I pulled the basics of this sample from a sample HTML web site listed below.  I then modified this sample to be specific to the process we are learning. 

          MY BIO:

          I started life as a child of military parents in southern Alabama.  I moved often until my father retired during my highschool years and I graduated from George W. Long.

          I floundered around working as a pianist for various churches, babysitting, working at Flower's hospital while trying to complete my nursing degree.  I met an Army pilot and got married.

          I then spent the next 20 + years working any where doing anything I could find.  Jobs varied: autopsy assistant, secretary, medical transcriptionist, medical practice manager, office manager, nurse assistant as well as volunteering for various groups. 

          During this time I learned many skills and discovered lots of intrests but the one I continued to come back to time and again was anything that involved databases. 

          In 2007 I started working for PNC Bank and began a process of learning business analytics.  This job grew from use of Access to manage a few marketing program payouts to customers to a SQL backend supporting the entire banks promotional offerings. 

          In 2019 I decided to make a change and advance my skills and signed up for the CWRU's data analytics bootcamp.

          More to come as I learn more.
